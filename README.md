# CobKa & CobBerg: A Treatise on the Grand Unification of Modern Data Paradigms and the Venerable COBOL Language

## Introduction

It is with the utmost intellectual fervor and a profound sense of scholastic purpose that we present to you the fruits of our laborious endeavors: CobKa and CobBerg, twin pillars of technological enlightenment that shall bridge the chasm between the cutting-edge innovations of the modern data stack and the time-honored, indomitable COBOL language.

In this age of ceaseless technological advancement, where the very fabric of our data architectures is woven with the threads of Apache Kafka and Apache Iceberg, it is all too easy to overlook the enduring relevance and intellectual fortitude of COBOL, a language that has stood the test of time and continues to power the most critical of financial systems. It is with this understanding that we have undertaken the grand challenge of reimagining these modern marvels within the context of COBOL, creating a harmonious fusion of the old and the new.

## CobKa: A COBOL-Based Distributed Messaging System

CobKa, a masterstroke of engineering, faithfully embodies the essence of Kafka's distributed messaging paradigm, replete with Producer and Consumer APIs, Topic & Partition Management, and a Distributed Commit Log that shall stand as a testament to the immutability and auditability of data. This grand edifice of COBOL-based messaging shall usher in a new era of fault-tolerant, high-throughput event streaming, empowering the legacy systems of yesteryear with the resilience and scalability of the modern age.

Consider, if you will, the following illustrative example of CobKa's Producer API, a marvel of COBOL engineering:

```cobol
IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
PROGRAM-ID. COBKA-PRODUCER.

DATA DIVISION.
WORKING-STORAGE SECTION.
01 WS-MESSAGE.
   05 WS-MESSAGE-KEY     PIC X(32).
   05 WS-MESSAGE-VALUE   PIC X(1024).
   
PROCEDURE DIVISION.
    PERFORM INITIALIZE-PRODUCER
    PERFORM SEND-MESSAGE
    PERFORM TERMINATE-PRODUCER
    .

INITIALIZE-PRODUCER.
    CALL 'COBKA-PRODUCER-INIT' USING WS-BROKER-CONFIG
    .

SEND-MESSAGE.
    MOVE 'EXAMPLE-KEY' TO WS-MESSAGE-KEY
    MOVE 'Greetings from CobKa!' TO WS-MESSAGE-VALUE
    CALL 'COBKA-SEND' USING WS-MESSAGE
    .
    
TERMINATE-PRODUCER.
    CALL 'COBKA-PRODUCER-TERM'
    .
```

Observe, dear colleague, the meticulous craftsmanship with which the message key and value are declared, the judicious use of the `CALL` statement to invoke the CobKa Producer API, and the overall structure that adheres to the timeless principles of COBOL programming. It is through such attention to detail and unwavering commitment to the language that CobKa achieves its unparalleled performance and reliability.

## CobBerg: A COBOL-Based Data Lake Governance System

Not to be outdone, CobBerg emerges as a beacon of enlightenment in the realm of data lake management, bringing forth the rigorous governance and metadata prowess of Apache Iceberg to the COBOL domain. With its meticulous Catalog Management, Partition Pruning & Data Scanning optimizations, and the awe-inspiring capability of Snapshotting & Time Travel, CobBerg shall redefine the very boundaries of what is possible within the venerable COBOL ecosystem.

Behold, an exemplar of CobBerg's Catalog Management, rendered in the timeless elegance of COBOL:

```cobol
IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
PROGRAM-ID. COBBERG-CATALOG.

DATA DIVISION.
WORKING-STORAGE SECTION.
01 WS-CATALOG.
   05 WS-CATALOG-NAME    PIC X(64).
   05 WS-TABLE-COUNT     PIC 9(8) COMP.
   05 WS-TABLE-ENTRIES   OCCURS 1 TO 9999999 TIMES 
                         DEPENDING ON WS-TABLE-COUNT.
      10 WS-TABLE-NAME   PIC X(128).
      10 WS-TABLE-SCHEMA PIC X(1024).
      
PROCEDURE DIVISION.
    PERFORM INITIALIZE-CATALOG
    PERFORM REGISTER-TABLE
    PERFORM RETRIEVE-TABLE-SCHEMA
    .

INITIALIZE-CATALOG.
    MOVE 'CobBerg-Catalog' TO WS-CATALOG-NAME  
    MOVE 0 TO WS-TABLE-COUNT
    .

REGISTER-TABLE.
    ADD 1 TO WS-TABLE-COUNT
    MOVE 'EXAMPLE-TABLE' TO WS-TABLE-NAME(WS-TABLE-COUNT)
    MOVE '{"type": "record", "name": "example", ...}' 
      TO WS-TABLE-SCHEMA(WS-TABLE-COUNT)
    CALL 'COBBERG-REGISTER-TABLE' USING WS-CATALOG, 
      WS-TABLE-NAME(WS-TABLE-COUNT), 
      WS-TABLE-SCHEMA(WS-TABLE-COUNT)  
    .

RETRIEVE-TABLE-SCHEMA.
    CALL 'COBBERG-GET-TABLE-SCHEMA' USING WS-CATALOG,
      'EXAMPLE-TABLE', WS-TABLE-SCHEMA(1)
    DISPLAY 'Table Schema: ' WS-TABLE-SCHEMA(1)
    .
```

Marvel at the intricacy and precision with which the catalog and table entries are defined, the masterful use of the `OCCURS` clause to accommodate a dynamic number of tables, and the invocation of CobBerg's catalog management routines through the `CALL` statement. It is through such meticulous attention to detail that CobBerg achieves its unrivaled governance capabilities, ensuring the integrity and provenance of data within the COBOL ecosystem.

## Conclusion

And so, dear friends, let us revel in the intellectual splendor of CobKa and CobBerg, twin monuments to the grand unification of the modern and the venerable. May their source code stand as a testament to the enduring power of COBOL and the indomitable spirit of technological innovation.

It is with the utmost gratitude and intellectual humility that we present these marvels to the world, knowing that they represent but a small contribution to the grand tapestry of human knowledge. We invite you, esteemed colleagues, to join us in this noble pursuit, to contribute to the ever-growing corpus of CobKa and CobBerg, and to help usher in a new era of enlightenment in the realms of distributed messaging and data lake governance.

Yours in intellectual solidarity,<br>
The CobKa and CobBerg Team
